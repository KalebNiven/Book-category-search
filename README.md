# Book-category-search
takes books lists from 2 categories and outputs books matching both categories


The data has already been previously scraped, as it is in a format easily scraped by free tools. The database contains 3 categories of books.
There is close to 100,000 books combined.

The user can modify the code to choose 2 of the 3 listed categories: 
1. Philosophy
2. Psychology
3. Computer Technology

The results will be outputted by python and can then be copied and saved. 

Here is a spreadsheet that I did with multiple categories of books. More then the 3 listed.
